### Quick Start ðŸš€

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/lpanigrahi/neogen-chatbot.git
cd neogen-chatbot

# 2. (Optional) Install pnpm if you don't have it

npm install -g pnpm

# 3. Install dependencies

pnpm i

# 4. (Optional) Start a local PostgreSQL instance

pnpm docker:pg

# If you already have your own PostgreSQL running, you can skip this step.
# In that case, make sure to update the PostgreSQL URL in your .env file.

# 5. Enter required information in the .env file

# The .env file is created automatically. Just fill in the required values.
# For the fastest setup, provide at least one LLM provider's API key (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.) and the PostgreSQL URL you want to use.

# 6. Start the server

pnpm build:local && pnpm start

# (Recommended for most cases. Ensures correct cookie settings.)
# For development mode with hot-reloading and debugging, you can use:
# pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.
